# Neolution.Extensions.Configuration.GoogleSecrets

This package is a configuration provider that injects google secrets into the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It is not recommended to store secrets like connection strings in the source code directly or in environment variables. The better approach is to use a secret provider like the [secret manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) for the google cloud eco system.
